Data Analyst,Publicis Groupe,"Madrid, Spain","transit data is the lifeblood of transit: everything else depends on it. when our data team does do a good job, life is serene like a tuscany sunset. users just open the app, and everything miraculously works! little do they know how many disparate datasets we have to wrangle, how many transit agency websites we have to monitor, how many sadistic bugs are out there waiting to pounce, how truly complex the ‚Äúsimplicity‚Äù of transit‚Äôs app belies... there‚Äôs never a dull moment when disruptions, strikes, last-minute network changes, and other mystery forces join together to threaten our users‚Äô with a missed bus or train.

but not on your watch!

as our newest transit data analyst, you‚Äôll be as busy as a bullet train, crawling openstreetmap, wikipedia, twitter, and other sources for the latest transit agency news (even if it‚Äôs not yet reflected in official data feeds), patching together data feeds where official ones don‚Äôt exist (like the location of station entrances or accessible transit... stops), and helping improve our automated tools ‚Äî ones which minimize the number of bad etas, and ensure the reliability of transit‚Äôs data.

your familiarity with public transit networks and your unflappable resourcefulness will keep us one step ahead of all the other apps out there: helping us map transit networks that everyone else thought were too tricky, broadening the types of data that our users have access to (like real-time vehicle crowding), and making sure that every transit user gets to experience that magical feeling of ‚Äúwow, it just works?‚Äù no matter their city, no matter the weirdness of the underlying data sources.

if you‚Äôre cunning, curious, and excited to make public transit more reliable for millions of riders across 200+ cities? give us a holler!

üìù responsibilities
‚Ä¢ develop a deep understanding of public transit networks in cities around the world to better serve transit‚Äôs riders
‚Ä¢ differentiate between transit services: modes, rolling stocks, infrastructures, operation patterns, etc.
‚Ä¢ use our existing tools (and improve upon them!) so we can deliver higher quality transit data in all our supported cities
‚Ä¢ make transit feel like ‚Äúhome‚Äù no matter the system: you‚Äôll have to overcome geographical and linguistic barriers to add support for new cities and countries, taking into account the specific quirks of every local transit network
‚Ä¢ work with our data team and propose improvements to our existing data management tools when you see the chance ‚Äî what processes can we automate? what can be done more efficiently? where can we find better data?
‚Ä¢ help us build out new features: ones that make better use of existing data, and ones that rely on entirely new data sources (how exciting‚Ä¶)

‚úÖ requirements
‚Ä¢ you are a fan of public transit and you are familiar with transit terminology: terminus, partial service, branch, headsign, etc.
‚Ä¢ extremely detail oriented. your attentiveness makes all the difference: it allows transit‚Äôs riders to relax, knowing they can always expect a reliable commuting experience. our users depend on you!
‚Ä¢ be curious, be nimble, think outside the boxcar. when you encounter an obstacle, your reaction shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúoh well‚Äù ‚Äî it should be ‚Äúhow can i overcome this like the crafty little minx i am?‚Äù keep in mind, you‚Äôll be handling data and documentation in unknown languages, often without any kind of faq‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢ satisfactory written communication skills in english (and, ideally, french) so you can be the liaison between our users and transit authorities. you won't be handling tech support, but you may send emails to users and agencies when there are data quality issues.
‚Ä¢ no programming skills required!
